# A Decade of Extreme Poverty: Trends, Severity, and Regional Disparities (2014–2023)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes **global extreme poverty trends over a 10-year period (2014–2023)** using multiple poverty metrics to move beyond simple headcount measures. The focus is on understanding **not only how many people are extremely poor, but how deep and severe that poverty is across regions**.

The analysis emphasizes **poverty severity (Squared Poverty Gap Ratio / SPR)**, supported by headcount, poverty gap, inequality indicators, inflation context (CPI), and welfare type (income vs consumption).

This project was developed as part of a **guided learning process**, with a strong emphasis on analytical reasoning, metric selection, and interpretation rather than visualization alone.

## Key Analytical Questions

* Where is extreme poverty **deepest and most severe** across regions?
* Has extreme poverty **improved or worsened** over the last decade?
* Do reductions in poverty headcount also reflect reductions in **poverty depth**?
* How does **inflation (CPI)** relate to poverty severity?
* Does poverty measurement differ when based on **income vs consumption**?

---

## Key Metrics & KPIs

* **Average Squared Poverty Gap Ratio (SPR)** (2014–2023)
* **10-Year Change in Poverty Severity**
* **Region with Highest Poverty Severity**
* **Region with Fastest Poverty Reduction**
* **Average Poverty Gap by Region**
* **Inequality Indicators among the Extreme Poor** (Watts, MLD)

---

## Analytical Approach

1. **Start with SPR** to identify where extreme poverty is most severe.
2. **Compare Headcount vs Poverty Gap** to separate population size from poverty depth.
3. **Use inequality indicators (Watts & MLD)** to examine disparities among the poorest households.
4. **Incorporate CPI** to contextualize how inflation may affect poverty severity.
5. **Segment by Welfare Type** (income vs consumption) to assess measurement sensitivity.

This layered approach ensures the analysis captures both **scale and intensity** of extreme poverty.

## Key Insights

* **Sub-Saharan Africa consistently exhibits the highest poverty severity**, indicating extreme poverty that is both widespread and deep.
* **Declines in poverty headcount do not always correspond to reductions in poverty depth**, suggesting the poorest households remain far below the poverty line.
* **High inequality among the extreme poor persists in several regions**, as reflected by elevated Watts and MLD values.
* **Regions experiencing higher inflation (CPI)** tend to maintain higher poverty severity, implying inflation may weaken poverty reduction efforts.
* **East Asia & Pacific shows the fastest reduction in poverty severity**, highlighting effective long-term poverty reduction strategies.

## Dashboard Components

* KPI summary cards (severity, change, regional extremes)
* SPR comparison by region
* Headcount vs Poverty Gap comparison
* Inequality indicators (Watts & MLD)
* CPI vs Poverty Severity visualization
* Interactive filters: **Year** and **Welfare Type**

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **SQL**: data aggregation, KPI calculation, trend analysis
* **Excel**: pivot tables, dashboard development, interactive filtering
* **Data Source**: [Public extreme poverty dataset (households below $10/day, based on income and consumption measures)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/isaaclopgu/share-of-population-living-in-extreme-poverty)

---

## Limitations

* The dataset focuses **only on the extreme poor population**, not the full income distribution.
* Inequality metrics (Gini) for the full population are not applicable in this context.
* CPI is used as contextual information and does **not imply causality**.

---

## Future Improvements

* Add country-level drill-down analysis
* Extend time horizon beyond 2023
* Integrate additional macroeconomic indicators
* Rebuild dashboard using BI tools (Power BI / Tableau)

## Author Note

This project represents a **learning-driven analytical workflow**, emphasizing how analysts reason through metric selection, validation, and interpretation. Guidance and iterative feedback were used throughout the process to refine analytical logic and storytelling.
