# About me

I work with data to understand processes, improve clarity, and support better decision-making.

This repository contains applied case studies that explore real-world business scenarios — from transaction analysis to operational reporting — with a focus on clean logic, structured workflows, and practical insights.

The objective is to build strong analytical foundations while developing the ability to transform raw data into clear, decision-ready information.
