# Project Overview

This project analyzes **global extreme poverty trends over a 10-year period (2014–2023)** using multiple poverty metrics to move beyond simple headcount measures. The focus is on understanding **not only how many people are extremely poor, but how deep and severe that poverty is across regions**.
    
The analysis emphasizes **poverty severity (Squared Poverty Gap Ratio / SPR)**, supported by headcount, poverty gap, inequality indicators, inflation context (CPI), and welfare type (income vs consumption).
    
This project was developed as part of a **guided learning process**, with a strong emphasis on analytical reasoning, metric selection, and interpretation rather than visualization alone.

# Key Analytical Questions
- Where is extreme poverty deepest and most severe across regions?
- Has extreme poverty **improved or worsened** over the last decade?
- Do reductions in poverty headcount also reflect reductions in poverty depth?
- How does **inflation (CPI)** relate to poverty severity?
- Does poverty measurement differ when based on income vs consumption?

# Key Metrics & KPIs
- **Average Squared Poverty Gap Ratio (SPR)** (2014–2023)
- **10-Year Change in Poverty Severity**
- **Region with Highest Poverty Severity**
- **Region with Fastest Poverty Reduction**
- **Average Poverty Gap by Region**
- **Inequality Indicators among the Extreme Poor** (Watts, MLD)

# Analytical Approach
1. **Start with SPR** to identify where extreme poverty is most severe.
2. **Compare Headcount vs Poverty Gap** to separate population size from poverty depth.
3. **Use inequality indicators (Watts & MLD)** to examine disparities among the poorest households.
4. **Incorporate CPI** to contextualize how inflation may affect poverty severity.
5. **Segment by Welfare Type** (income vs consumption) to assess measurement sensitivity.

# Key Insights
- **Sub-Saharan Africa consistently exhibits the highest poverty severity**, indicating extreme poverty that is both widespread and deep.
- **Declines in poverty headcount do not always correspond to reductions in poverty depth**, suggesting the poorest households remain far below the poverty line.
- **High inequality among the extreme poor persists in several regions**, as reflected by elevated Watts and MLD values.
- **Regions experiencing higher inflation (CPI)** tend to maintain higher poverty severity, implying inflation may weaken poverty reduction efforts.
- **East Asia & Pacific shows the fastest reduction in poverty severity**, highlighting effective long-term poverty reduction strategies.

# Limitations
- The dataset focuses **only on the extreme poor population**, not the full income distribution.
- Inequality metrics (Gini) for the full population are not applicable in this context.
- CPI is used as contextual information and does **not imply causality**

# Future Improvements
- Add country-level drill-down analysis
- Extend time horizon beyond 2023
- Integrate additional macroeconomic indicators
- Rebuild dashboard using BI tools (Power BI / Tableau)
